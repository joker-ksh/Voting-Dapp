# Decentralized Voting Application on Local Ethereum Blockchain
## Setup Instructions

To run this application, follow these steps:

### 1. Install Dependencies
```sh
npm install
```

### 2. Start Hardhat's Local Blockchain
```sh
npx hardhat node
```
This command starts a local Ethereum blockchain and generates multiple test accounts with free ETH. These accounts can be used for development and testing.

### 3. Add Hardhat Network to MetaMask
To use the test accounts in MetaMask, follow these steps:
1. Open MetaMask and go to **Settings** â†’ **Networks**.
2. Click **Add Network** and select **Add a network manually**.
3. Enter the following details:
   - **Network Name**: Hardhat Localhost
   - **New RPC URL**: http://127.0.0.1:8545
   - **Chain ID**: 31337
   - **Currency Symbol**: ETH
4. Click **Save**.
5. Now, go to **MetaMask -> Import Account**.
6. Copy one of the private keys from the Hardhat node terminal and paste it to import a test account.

### 4. Compile and Deploy the Smart Contract
#### **Compile the Contract**
```sh
npx hardhat compile
```

#### **Deploy the Contract to the Local Blockchain**
```sh
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```
After deployment, copy the **contract address** displayed in the terminal and paste it into the `.env` file.

### 5. Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following details:
```env
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
CONTRACT_ADDRESS=your_deployed_contract_address
```
Use one of the **test accounts** generated by Hardhat's local blockchain and imported into MetaMask for transactions.

### 6. Run the Backend Server
```sh
node index.js
```

### 7. Interact with the Application
Open your browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:3000
```
Now you can interact with the **Decentralized Voting Application**.

---
### Notes
- The application runs on **Hardhat's local blockchain** instead of **Volta**.
- The `.env` file is used for convenience, storing the **private key** and **contract address**.
- Ensure you are using a MetaMask account linked to one of the **test accounts** from Hardhat.
- Restart the Hardhat node and redeploy the contract if needed.

Enjoy voting on the blockchain! ðŸš€
